One of the most powerful new features being explored in Elements is Confidential
Transactions.  This keeps the amounts transferred visible only to participants
in the transaction (and those they designate), while still guaranteeing that no
more coins can be spent than are available in a cryptographic way.

This goes a step beyond the usual privacy offered by Bitcoin's blockchain, which
relies purely on pseudonymous (but public!) identities.  This matters, because
insufficient financial privacy can have serious security and privacy
implications for both commercial and personal transactions. Without adequate
protection, thieves and scammers can focus their efforts on known high-value
targets, competitors can learn business details, and negotiating positions can
be undermined.

### Using Confidential Transactions
The payment flow when using the Confidential Transactions Element is nearly
identical to Bitcoin Core on the surface:

```
$ elements-cli getnewaddress
> CTEwQjyErENrxo8dSQ6pq5atss7Ym9S7P6GGK4PiGAgQRgoh1iPUkLQ168Kqptfnwmpxr2Bf7ipQsagi

$ elements-cli sendtoaddress CTEwQjyErENrxo8dSQ6pq5atss7Ym9S7P6GGK4PiGAgQRgoh1iPUkLQ168Kqptfnwmpxr2Bf7ipQsagi 0.005
> 82b2c5122207e5f33e7adadc6a4aab16a170e16028f0b0cf2c04f9d17d6f0321
// ^ this is the transaction id
```

The key difference from Bitcoin is the addition of cryptographic privacy. These
transactions differ in that the amounts transferred are kept visible only to
participants in the transaction (and those they designate).

The ``createrawtransaction`` API in Elements works similar to Bitcoin's raw
transactions with the following differences:

1. The intent to create a confidential output is indicated by using a confidential address for the destination.
2. The ``createrawtransaction`` RPC has the additional key ``nValue`` per input which must be set to the value of the input. The value can be determined for example with the ``listunspent`` RPC.
3. After calling ``createrawtransaction`` the user must call ``blindrawtransaction`` on the transaction if a confidential input or output address is involved.
4. If at least one of the inputs is confidential, at least one of the outputs must be confidential. Note that it is perfectly fine to create a 0-valued confidential output if otherwise there would be no confidential output.
5. If all inputs are unconfidential, the number of confidential outputs must be ``0`` or ``>= 2``. Again, it's fine to create a 0-valued confidential output.

The following example spends a confidential and an unconfidential output and
creates a confidential and unconfidential output. Due to the size of the
transaction it is not displayed here but saved in the variable ``TX``

```
TX=`elements-cli createrawtransaction '[{"txid": "421079661b117b659af3431096ce2118043396e3647e523e413cd626fa798df7", "vout": 0, "nValue": 0.001}, {"txid": "17aa26d29582a9a26f02033918aaf9823d33458239074a0d7ee638b247f1fa2c", "vout": 0, "nValue": 0.001}]' '{"XoRDiv9z12ECsYCNjtHjDvV1Nn4KSBa6xRfHT1c3nKY1CwDiz5rzSMZL7QCgvuF1T5Kq43o1fMqBxbWQ": 0.001, "QLsHc5DgnpMjPaDSuEF5gXt7ccgmLtgh2N": 0.0005}'`
TX=`elements-cli blindrawtransaction $TX`
TX=`elements-cli signrawtransaction $TX | jq -r '.hex'`
elements-cli sendrawtransaction $TX
```

### Limitations
The implementation of Confidential Transactions as it appears in Elements has
some important limitations to be aware of.

For example, the implementation only hides a certain number of the digits of the
amount of each transaction output, dependent on the range proof's "blinding
coverage" at a desired precision level.  Subsequently, there is a 'minimum
confidential amount' of around 0.0001 BTC, and a 'maximum confidential amount'
that is 2<sup>32</sup> times the minimum amount.

Digits smaller than the minimum will be revealed to observers; for example, if
the minimum is 0.0001 BTC, a transaction output of 123.456789 BTC will look like
"?.????89 BTC". The tiny amount of information about the value leaked in this
way is unlikely to be important, but be aware that this could allow observers to
'follow' coins by linking subsequent transactions with identical amounts. All
values can be rounded to the minimum to avoid revealing information in this way
if preferred.

A transaction output larger than the maximum will reveal the order of magnitude
of the amount to observers, _and_ will reveal additional digits at the bottom of
the amount.

For example, if the maximum is 500k BTC, then all outputs under
that amount will look the same, but an output between 500k and 5M BTC will be
visible as such to observers (but not the exact amount within that range), and
will also reveal one additional digit of the low end of the amount. Revealing
the range in this way could be a very significant privacy leak; splitting such
extremely large transactions to keep them under the maximum confidential amount
is strongly recommended.
